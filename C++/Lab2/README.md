# Lab 2
This lab implements:

- `LinkedList` A single linked list
    - `SinglyLinkedNode`
- `DoublyLinkedList` A doubly linked list
    - `DoublyLinkedNode`
- `StaticArrayList` An array list implementation using static arrays.

I have actually recently re-implemeted this lab since my previous implementation was slightly problematic. This new version is much improved over the old one.
