# [Data Structures & Algorithms](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/README.md): [Labs](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/README.md)

## [Lab 1: Getting Ready](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab1/README.md) ([Core](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab1/core/README.md))
```shell
python labs 1
```

In this first lab, the core exercises aren't proper exercises, and aren't about data structures and algorithms from the
lectures. What they are is some basic Python written using the features we'll be using in this module, and a way for you
to get used to running the testing framework. If you understand these, then you should be fine Python-wise and can
concentrate on the actual module content, but if not, then you should try to quickly learn what you need to ahead of the
coming labs, as we will be diving straight into it next week. If you find that you're struggling at first, a point of
reassurance is to note that by the very act of working on the exercises you will improve - through practice, through
doing, you will build familiarity and confidence with the language. Another is that you won't actually be writing
massive amounts of code, as generally the bits that need filling in represent relatively few lines - the point is that
they are fairly thoughtful lines, and you will likely find that the main component of completing the labs is
understanding conceptually what ought to be done, rather than figuring out how to write that in Python. Still, you will
need to be able to read and understand the existing code of the partial implementations in order to complete them.

We're not going to provide a whole Python tutorial here - there are many online and elsewhere - but rather showcase most
of the features we'll be using, so you can prioritise what you need to go off and learn about. If you understand these
exercises, you're 90%+ of the way there.
