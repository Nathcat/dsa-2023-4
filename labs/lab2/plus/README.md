# [Data Structures & Algorithms](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/README.md): [Labs](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/README.md)

## [Lab 2: Lists](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab2/README.md) ([Plus](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab2/plus/README.md))
```shell
python labs 2+
```

Having realised the abstract concept of a list in three distinct ways in the core exercises, you will have noticed that
different implementations can have different efficiencies for the same operations.

In these plus "exercises" (that aren't exercises at all, while we're easing into the module - those will come next lab),
we consider two different applications involving lists, and see how - given which list operations they are going to be
primarily using - they better suit different types of list.
